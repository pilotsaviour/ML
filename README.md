# 🚀 Data Science Journey Repository 📊

Welcome to my Data Science journey repository! 🌟 This is where I document my learning process, code snippets, and progress in becoming a Data Scientist. Each section of this README outlines different aspects of my learning, including variables, data types, lists, dictionaries, and more.

## 🌐 Introduction
- Dive into the fascinating world of data science with me! 🚀 This repository serves as my learning journal as I embark on the thrilling journey of becoming a Data Scientist.

## 👋 Hello World
- My first .ipynb file, "HelloWorld.ipynb," contains a simple Python script to print "Hello World" and introduces basic concepts.

## 🧠 Variables, Data Types, Lists, and Dictionaries
- I've kicked off my journey by mastering variables, data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans), and various data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

### 💡 Variables
- Explored declaring variables for different data types such as strings, integers, floats, and booleans.

### 📝 Data Types
- Detailed explanations and examples of string, integer, float, and boolean data types.

### 📊 Lists
- Unveiled the magic of creating lists, indexing, mutability, and operations like update, append, insert, and delete.

### 🔄 Tuples
- Introduced tuples, their immutability, and indexing.

### 🔍 Sets
- Created sets, highlighting their uniqueness by not allowing duplicate values.

### 🔄 Type Casting
- Explored type casting, converting a list to a set to eliminate duplicates.

### 📚 Dictionaries
- Covered the basics of dictionaries, including creation, reading values, updating, and deleting.

## ⚙️ Conditions and Loops
- This section will uncover the power of conditions and loops in Python, building on the foundation laid in previous sections.
